state machine
-------------

code generated using the old Object Mentor [State Machine Compiler](http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/downloads.html) ([PDF](http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/umlfsm.pdf)).
Get it from the links to regenerate the state machine


For demonstration purposes the [rlutil](https://github.com/tapio/rlutil) header is included.
